If the button with id 'toggleModal' is clicked:
- The modal should become visible to screen readers.
- The page content should become hidden from screen readers.
- The button text should display "Close Modal".
- The button itself should not become hidden from screen readers.

If the button with id 'toggleModal' is clicked again:
- The modal should get the opposite state of what it was before.
- The page should get the opposite state of what it was before.
- The button text should display the opposite text of what it was before.

The provided HTML code is semantically incorrect and must be fixed.
To achieve this, use appropriate semantic tags and only ARIA attributes (no CSS hiding).
No inline JS code.
